# Sveltia CMS Example

Project to demonstrate how to launch Sveltia CMS.

I am developing this as a learning point for myself, but thought I'd
share what I have, for anyone else jumping into this or wanting to
suggest improvements.

Treat this as a work in progress.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Manual vs Automatic

 - `index.html` launches using the config.yml
 - `index-manual.html` launches using the config in src/main.js
